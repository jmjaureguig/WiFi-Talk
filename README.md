# Summary
Everything started with a comment during a twitch live on
[zerialkiller](https://www.twitch.tv/zerialkillerhacking) channel, someone
suggested of ways to find WiFi devices and here I am a couple of months later.

The first part is how to keep your hardware safe, electronics after reaching
their limits, there is no `UNDO` button. And as described in the disclaimer,
this is a slow (but working) prototype with the sole objective of learning,
to serve as a minimal base to start. Check the video, I'm sure you will
find many ideas on how to continue.


# The parts

This play have four acts:
1. RF hardware connections and not frying electronics.
2. Simple arduino firmware that moves the antenna.
3. Slow and inefficient scripts capturing and plotting data.
4. Creating plots.


## RF hardware

### Pringles can

This is a bad option, the diameter is off by several millimeters. In the other
and, it is easy to get one, easy to drill and install the monopole. Make a 6mm
hole from the back of the can to install the dipole later.


### 1/4 wave monopole

**SMA and RP-SMA connector**
There are two types of SMA connectors, SMA and RP-SMA, the RP for
reverse-polarity, RF-SMA was designed to comply with FCC regulations and
avoid what we are going to do, connect Wi-Fi equipment to radio equipment not
designed for that. Check the connector and buy the adapter you need.

The total length is ~31-mm including any extra length from the connector
itself. The first time I made one of these antennas I used calipers and
sand paper to be sure the length was right down to 0.1-mm now that I have
the equipment to see how close it needs to be, you can save time,
+/-1-mm is close enough, in fact I tried 29-mm to 34-mm there are differences
on performance and they will work too.

### Unnecessary 3D printed parts

I make a clamp to hold the cantenna, hold the USB dongle on top and plug into
the stepper motor axis directly. I'm using a *28BYJ-48* motor, in case you use
the same check the [OpenSCAD](wifi-DF-mount.scad) just change
`axis_d` and `axis_t` to make the square hole match the axis of your motor.

You need this? No. Duct-tape and hot-glue are much faster and simple. My inner
child wants to persuade my adult me that it wasn't an impulse buy.

**NOTE:** Please check the video with zerialkiller there are more details there
that I can add here. Hardware can make or break the project, modifying 90-cm
parabolic antennas to use bi-quad feeds will increase coverage area and detect
devices with lower power output. The issue is you loose accuracy, instead of
0.5-m indoors you will get several meters on proportionally larger area.


## Arduino firmware 

[Sketch](arduino-stepper-sketch/arduino-stepper-sketch.ino)

Here things start to get inefficient (even more). The arduino expect commands
on serial port, three, no four, no five. Three üòÅ
1. **R** to reset the counter this defines the current heading of the antenna to
zero.
2. **cNNNN** get the current position of the antenna it is the step counter.
NNNN is a four digits number.
3. **gNNNN** go-to `NNNN` position, it needs to be a 4-digit number, leading
empty spaces for 999 and lower must be zeros.

Why this is slow? After a go-to the arduino doesn't reply to any messages. If
you thought on requesting a full circle, capture data and get the position
during the rotation to increase readout speed, you are in the right path. Fix
this issue and you can reduce time.


## Slow and inefficient scripts.
