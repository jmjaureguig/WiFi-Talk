# Summary
Everything started with a comment during a twitch live on
[zerialkiller](https://www.twitch.tv/zerialkillerhacking) channel, someone
suggested of ways to find WiFi devices and here I am a couple of months later.

The first part is how to keep your hardware safe, electronics after reaching
their limits, there is no `UNDO` button. And as described in the disclaimer,
this is a slow and crapy prototype with the sole objective of learning, to serve
as a minimal base to start. Check the video, I'm sure you will find many ideas
on how to continue.
